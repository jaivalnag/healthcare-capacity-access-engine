Project Title: UF Health Clinical Throughput & Capacity Simulator This tool identifies the "Administrative Lag" in hospital bed turnover. In a high-occupancy environment like UF Health, "dead time" (the gap between a patient being medically ready and the bed being sanitized for the next patient) represents a significant loss in patient access.
How AI Can Help Solve This Problem: > While this tool quantifies the gap, the solution lies in Predictive AI tools to analyze patient intake. By utilizing AI to analyze real-time patient data, we can predict discharge windows much earlier and with better accuracy. This allows for the faster more tailored care effectively eliminating the lag modeled in this calculator.

How to Use
1. Input the Staffed Bed Count for the specific unit.

2. Adjust the Average Length of Stay (ALOS) based on the clinical setting.

3. Observe how a reduction in Admin Lag (achievable through better patient intake) directly increases the number of additional patients the hospital can serve annually.
